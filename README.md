# Weather-bot

This is a simple discord bot I'm writing to gain more practice with Golang, as I'm finding that I very much enjoy the language and wish to get better at it.

## Technical info
This bot was written in `Golang 1.12.6` and makes use of the [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) library to serve as a wrapper for the Discord API in order to focus more time on the actual weather API Logic.

For the weather API I went with [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev) as I've used it before and very much like how simple it is to get started, as well as how generous they are with their request limits.


Some really awesome Vim Plugins that I use in all of my development work/projects, including this one:
- [vim-instant-markdown](https://github.com/suan/vim-instant-markdown) - For live markdown previews
- [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot) - For useful syntax features for almost any language you can think of
- [Badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf) - Really nice Vim colour scheme
